# Core data import testing

This is a sample project for [CoreDataImportKit](https://github.com/orangeqc/CoreDataImportKit) to show off its speed improvements over MagicalRecord.

The main benefits of CoreDataImportKit can be seen when you are importing data  which overlaps with existing data (that is, updating existing data). That is why this program has the option to import half of the data set.

This is a very simple program which could be expanded in time to include comparisons to other import frameworks.

# Roadmap

There isn’t a high priority to updating this project, but eventually I’d like to add the following:

* Automated test suite which will run a standard set of tests across all libraries.
* Improve the import data to include relationships between employees.
* Simple presentation view to see imported data.
* Move imports into operations.
* Add [EasyMapping](https://github.com/EasyMapping/EasyMapping) for comparison.
* Add graphs to this readme.

If you would like to contribute, please feel free to fork and create a pull request.
